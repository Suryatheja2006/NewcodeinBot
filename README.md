# NewcodeinBot
# The code we uploaded in our ESP-32 enable us to operate our bot to turn while moving forward or backward, instead of stopping first to make a turn. We also adjusted our code to make turnings sharper so that it becomes useful on the track.
# We were motivated to give our best in this competition by watching the last year's videos of XLR8.
# We basically just edited the already uploaded model code on 'XLR8 Homepage'.
# We changed the code on our own by understanding that language a little bit from the model code itself.
